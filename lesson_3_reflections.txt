When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. Backup
2. Can access/reference from any computer
3. Can eat lots of pizza.
4. To enable others to work on the same project as well

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1.You may be working on a certain feature set and not want everything to be overwritten.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is to break off your own version from a git repository if you can't edit the original. There won't be a merge of the two.

Clones is making a local copy of the GitHub repository or vice versa

Branches are different code paths on the same respository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you can work on the latest code

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Email! SVN! Pizza Boxes. It'd be easier to just update a shared drive, but it'd be harder to track changes and merge

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Scale of change, proof of concept work, experimental work, spike work you'd throw away.
